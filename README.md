This is a checklist of Disney movies me and my wife has watched while eating waffles for Sunday breakfast.

~~The movies are updated by scraping [the wikipedia list of Disney theatrical releases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Disney_theatrical_animated_feature_films), retaining the 'watched' status that is updated by hand.~~

Because of the fickle nature of wikipedia articles I decided it was easier to just add the movies to the markdown file by hand for now.
